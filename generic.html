								<h2>Men with Migraine: How Migraine Disease Impacts Men</h2>
								<p>What is Migraine disease? <br>
									<br>Unlike what you might think, a migraine is not just a headache.
									It is a neurological disease with no cure and is still extremely stigmatized. <br>
									<br>Migraine consists of excruciating and disabling pain that usually presents on one side of the head but can also occur on both sides. 
									Migraine is not just unbearable pain alone. It also comes with nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, also known as an aura, temporary blindness, dizziness, sensitivity to light, sound, smell, and other symptoms.
									Migraine is a severely disabling and incapacitating primary headache disorder, yet most people still have no idea what migraine is and how it affects its patients. 
									According to disturbmenot.co; Migraine causes impairment of daily activities costing the US more than $35 billion annually and almost 160 million working days a year. 
									Migraine affects 39 million people in the United States and 1 billion people worldwide. In the United States, 18% of migraineurs are women, 6% are men, and 10% are children. 
									Migraine fighters use twice the amount of medical resources and require more medications and visits to emergency departments.<br>
									
									<br>We know that migraine affects more women than men but let’s look at some of the differences between them. 
									Women seem to experience more comorbidities and psychological issues; Whereas men, according to one of Harvard’s studies (health.harvard.edu), examined an increase in men’s heart attack and stroke risk. 
									This study reported that men with migraine disease could increase their chances of cardiovascular complications by 42%.<br>
									
									<br>There are many different triggers for migraines. Men seem to have other triggers than women when it comes to migraine disease. 
									While women’s triggers involve hormonal changes. Men’s triggers seem more to do with lifestyle choices and physical activity. 
									Men are also less likely to seek treatment than women. All migraine fighters have different triggers. 
									A primary trigger for men is physical exertion ranging from walking upstairs to running a marathon. 
									Some research shows this can be due to hypersensitive blood vessels that contract and dilate. Other triggers can include insomnia, dehydration, stress, low blood sugar, and food and drinks.<br>
									
									<br>I had the pleasure of speaking with Charlie from Annapolis. Charlie is a business owner and stay at home, dad. 
									His migraine fight started about four years ago. His triggers are overworking, not getting enough sleep, and lifting objects over his head. 
									He experiences migraines approximately twice a week. When his migraine is at its strongest, he definitely can not work and is incapcitated. 
									He spent a year or so trying to rule out headaches due to allergies, foods, and other environmental factors. Still, he was diagnosed by his neurologist with chronic migraine with aura, and occipital neuralgia. 
									Charles is on multiple medications, including calcium channel blocker, anti-epileptic, SSNRI, and triptan. He knows that he would not be able to work a “normal” job due to his migraines.<br>
									
									<br>Even though men are less likely to seek out professional medical treatment for migraines, they still experience the same excruciating pain as women with migraine. 
									If you are a man that experiences migraines, please seek out professional treatment and diagnoses. Having migraine disease does not make you any less of a man. 
									You can find many support groups for migraines, with many men experiencing the daily effects of this incurable neurological disorder.</p>
