										<p>WHAT THE MIGRAINE FIGHTER IS ALL ABOUT! <br>
											<br>Do you suffer from frequent painful migraines? If so, you’ve come to the right place. <br>
											<br>Welcome to the Migraine Fighter! <br>
											<br>We’re a blog and website dedicated to educating and stopping the stigma of migraine and other headache disease.  
											I use my background as a pharmacy technician to find and share the most up to date information possible.  <br>
											<br>I have personally been fighting migraine disease since childhood.  
											When I was a child not much was known about migraine and most people just thought it was a “BAD HEADACHE”, well it is not!  
											I have and will continue to fight and stop the stigma that comes along with migraine and headache disease.  <br>
											<br>I will share my journey with chronic intractable migraine as well as giving product reviews on all the things that I try and have 
											tried to help combat migraine.<br>
											
											<br>I can honestly say that as a child I had no idea that the head pain and vomiting I experienced was migraine.  
											Now that I am 42 years old and a lot more educated I can tell you that even doctors don’t fully understand migraine disease, 
											especially since the experiences are different for everyone that fights migraine and headache diseases.  
											My migraine was always episodic until 2014 when it became chronic intractable.  <br>
											<br>I finally had to give up my career as a hospital pharmacy technician which I trully loved because I could no longer function.  
											I am currently disabled and hope that a cure will soon be found.  <br>
											<br>So many things about migraine and headache disease have been learned in recent years and in 2018 some amazing new medication 
											came out that has helped many fighters.  <br>
											<br>I knew that I had to share my experience with migraine and all the products and medication that I have tried to fight them 
											with the world!  
											You can trust that I will deliver a candid review on all products that I use and try every single time. <br>
											<br>Since all migraine and headache fighters are different what works for one person might not work for another.  
											So just keep that in mind when trying new things.  While I do have some affiliations with this blog, they are products that I use personally and vouch for 100%. 
											In fact, they’re the products that I would say keep me going and help me to be my best self.  <br>
											<br>I just want others to realize that you are not alone in this fight and that you are beautiful and amazing.<br>
											
											<br>If you struggle with frequent migraines that are hard to treat, you’ll love my blog. <br>
											<br> I’ve been in your shoes, and I know how frustrating it can be. On my website, you’ll find both organic treatments as well as traditional medicine. 
											I’ve found both to be effective. I will endorse any product that I know works, and I will be honest and critical in all my reviews. <br>
											
											<br>If you suffer from migraines, you owe it to yourself to subscribe to my blog. 
											That way you can stay up to date on the latest treatments and remedies for migraines. 
											Feel free to read on to learn more about me and why I started this blog!</p>

											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I’m Kristin Kishi~The Migraine Fighter! <br> 
											<br>I was born January 26, 1978 in Pasadena, Califronia.  <br>
											<br>I fight chronic intractable migraine along with depression, anxiety and social anxiety.  
											Here is the low down on my migraine fight.  <br>
											<br>My first memorable experience with migraine disease was in 1990 when I was in 7th grade.  
											I was in the quad in junior high school and the bell had just rung to go to homeroom.  
											All of a sudden while standing next to my best friend my eyesight just disappeared.  No sight, just blackness!  
											My best friend walked me to the nurses office and they immediately called my mom.  <br>

											<br>My mom a Registered Nurse at the time knew exactly what was happening to me.  
											Unfortunately, Migraine Disease can be hereditary and in my case it is on the maternal side.  
											My great-grandmother, grandmother, mother, and now myself all fought or fight migraine.  
											I also know that I have several cousins that also fight this disabling disease.  
											I even had a cousin that took his own life because of the pain that migraine caused him.  <br>
											<br>Recently I found a letter that I wrote to my mom and dad in 1987 that said thank you for being there when I’m sick.  
											You always help me when I have a headache and stomach ache too.  
											Now I believe that I was experiencing migraine since I was a child even though I didn’t know that is what it was at the time. 
											I like most people that fight migraine started out having episodic migraine.  <br>
											<br>As of 2013, my migraine became chronic intractable and I could no longer function in a normal way.  
											I was constantly in pain and it caused fatigue, confusion and just a feeling of worthlessness.  
											I went from being a hospital pharmacy technician making IV’s for patients to someone who could barely get out of bed to go to the bathroom.  
											I continued trying to work and thought that a desk job would be better for me unfortunately that only seemed to make matters worse.  
											I spent a year working for a health insurance company in the appeals department until I finally had to go out on disability.  
											This was devistating for me because I got my first job as soon as I turned 16 and was able to work.   
											I loved being a pharmacy technician and helping people and suddenly I was the one needing help.  
											This was absolutely soul crushing for me.  I felt lost and helpless and had no idea what I was going to do.<br>

											<br>In 2015 I decided that I wanted to share my experience with migraine disease and the stigma that goes along with it.  
											So I started using social media to get the word out about migraine and the stigma that myself and so many others live with on a daily basis.  
											I have always wanted to do more for my migraine community but just didn’t know how to go about it.  
											With the help of some amazing migraine fighters, I have found that just by sharing my story I could help others so…<br>
											
											<br>I now have my very own blog and am wanting to eduate those who don’t understand migraine disease and also support all my fellow migraine fighters out there. <br> 
											<br>We want you to know that “It’s not just a headache, it is a neurological disease with NO CURE!"</p>

										<h3>Migraine Research Foundation</h3>
										<p>Opening doors to a cure for migraine disease by raising money to fund research to discover the causes, improve the treatments and find a cure.<br>
											With your help, Migraine Research has funded 94 migraine researchers in 12 countries.
											They fund cutting-edge research that will help sufferers by adding to the understanding and treatment of migraine disease.<br></p>

										<h3>#Unfriend Chronic Migraine</h3>
										<p>Chronic Migraine follows you around more days than not. It’s defined as at least 8 MIGRAINE DAYS per month, and a total of 15 or more MIGRAINE OR HEADACHE DAYS per month. <br>
											3.3 million people in the United States are living with Chronic Migraine. If all of those people made up a city, it’d be the 3rd largest city in the US! <br>
											Nearly 2/3 of people who are living with Chronic Migraine have not been properly diagnosed, based on a study of 200 people who saw a specialist.<br>
											Chronic Migraine is a time thief, causing those living with it to miss an average of 63 days of work, school, and family time over a 3-month period, including time that was less productive.<br>

										<h3>Join the Migraine Community</h3>
										<p>Migraine is much more than a headache. Because few realize that it’s a neurobiological disease, people with migraine may experience stigma and discrimination. 
											You may feel isolated and shamed, as if no one understands. The Miles for Migraine Community Groups bring together the people just like you to connect, discover and share. 
											They provide helpful resources and supportive discussions to help you better navigate life with migraine.</p>

									<h2>What Causes Migraines</h2>
									<p>This list is not all inclusive, each person is different and there are far too many triggers to list here.</p>
								</header>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon solid fa-gem"></span>
										<strong>Genetics</strong> Studies suggest that half of the risk for migraines comes from your family history. If a relative has migraine, you are more likely to have it.
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
										<strong>Food & Drink</strong> Skipping meals, caffeine withdrawal, and alcohol can all lead to migraines
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon solid fa-gem"></span>
										<strong>Hormonal Changes</strong> Sudden shifts in hormone levels, such as during menstral periods are a large factor for a lot of women
									</li>
									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon fa-gem"></span>
										<strong>Changes in Sleep</strong> A change in your sleep schedule, whether too much or too little, can set off migraines
									</li>
									<li class="style5">
										<span class="icon solid fa-gem"></span>
										<strong>Stress</strong> A stressful time can be a trigger, but migraine can show up once you are relaxed after  the stressful time is over
